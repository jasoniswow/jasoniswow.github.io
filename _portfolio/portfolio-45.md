A survey of the inner Galaxy region of Galactic longitude ![$l\in [+15^\circ ,+50^\circ ]$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/817/1/3/revision1/apj521936ieqn1.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691719011&Signature=jC88lF1BP3CYZ%2BL64Rer%2B0J92Y8%3D) and latitude ![$b\in [-4^\circ ,+4^\circ ]$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/817/1/3/revision1/apj521936ieqn2.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691719011&Signature=KnsBqsmfXaKTvxNPfzbjOJwAAlc%3D) is performed using one-third of the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory, operated during its construction phase. To address the ambiguities arising from unresolved sources in the data, we use a maximum likelihood technique to identify point source candidates. Ten sources and candidate sources are identified in this analysis. Eight of these are associated with known TeV sources but not all have differential fluxes that are compatible with previous measurements. Three sources are detected with significances >5 *Ïƒ* after accounting for statistical trials, and are associated with known TeV sources.

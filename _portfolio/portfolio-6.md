Cytokines are small protein molecules exhibit potent immunoregulatory properties, which are known as the essential components of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). While some cytokines are known to be universally upregulated in TIME, the unique cytokine expression patterns have not been fully resolved in specific types of cancers. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data was collected from multiple public repositories, filtered and processed to visualize the cytokine expressions in different immune cells in TIME. The TIME dataset including 39 cancer types was constructed based on the 695 processed immune cell-containing samples. With a random forest model, unique cytokine expression patterns were identified for various cancer categories with high accuracy of nearly 80%. The results will not only boosting the understanding of the cancer type-specific immune modulations in TIME, but also server as an crucial reference for future diagnostic and therapeutic researches in cancer immunity.

Colitis is a commonly encountered inflammatory disease in colon tissue, which can be triggered by various causes. Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been utilized for the treatment of colitis, it is still a great challenge to identify the major bioactive constituents and their modes of action among thousands of ingredients in TCM prescriptions. Inspired by the success of artificial intelligence and deep learning methods, we proposed a deep neural network (DNN) for TCM prescription recommendation. We constructed a graph-based DNN with 9,845 nodes and 161,950 edges, which integrated microscopic information including bioactive molecules, protein targets, and extracted features of prescriptions through feature embedding. A novel and efficient data augmentation strategy was implemented to expand the sample size based on 378 collected TCM prescriptions. Network pharmacology study revealed that the 10 most frequent ingredients in generated prescriptions were associated with multiple inflammatory signaling pathways. To verify the bioactive constituents in the generated prescriptions, 5 selected constituents were administrated to BALB/c mice with colitis. Suppressive effects of disease progression and pro-inflammatory factors comparable to sulfasalazin were observed with these compounds, revealing the effectiveness of our artificial intelligence strategy on identification of bioactive constituents from TCM prescriptions.

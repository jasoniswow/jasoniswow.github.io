The high altitude water cherenkov gamma-ray observatory (HAWC) has been fully operational since March of 2015 in Mexico at 4,100 meters above sea level on the hillside of the Sierra Negra Volcano. It consists of an array of 300 water cherenkov detectors, each equipped with four photo-multiplier tubes. HAWC operates 24-hours per day with a wide field-of-view (FOV,∼ 2sr) and a high duty cycle (∼ 95%). These make it a powerful survey and monitoring experiment for mapping the gamma ray sky at very high energies (VHE, 100 GeV to 100 TeV) and to detect sources with varying intensities. Thus HAWC is well suited to detect gamma-ray counterparts of possible flaring sources seen in neutrino events observed by IceCube or gravitational wave events observed by LIGO/Virgo.

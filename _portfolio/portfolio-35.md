Several cosmic-ray detectors have found more positrons arriving at Earth than expected. Some researchers interpret this as a signature of exotic physics, such as the annihilation of dark matter particles. Others prefer a more mundane explanation that involves positron generation at pulsars followed by diffusion to Earth. Abeysekara *et al.* detected extended emission of gamma rays around two nearby pulsars, generated by high-energy electrons and positrons. The size of the extended emission was used to calculate how far positrons generated by the pulsars diffuse through spaceâ€”which turns out to be insufficient to reach Earth. The excess positrons detected on Earth must therefore have a more exotic origin than nearby pulsars.

We present results from daily monitoring of gamma-rays in the energy range from ∼0.5 to ∼100 TeV with the first 17 months of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. Its wide field of view of 2 steradians and duty cycle of ![$\gt 95$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/841/2/100/revision1/apjaa729eieqn1.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691718888&Signature=MYVOp1yLhdzqPwq3tf8zews07eA%3D)% are unique features compared to other TeV observatories that allow us to observe every source that transits over HAWC for up to ∼6 hr each sidereal day. This regular sampling yields unprecedented light curves from unbiased measurements that are independent of seasons or weather conditions. For the Crab Nebula as a reference source, we find no variability in the TeV band. Our main focus is the study of the TeV blazars Markarian (Mrk) 421 and Mrk 501. A spectral fit for Mrk 421 yields a power-law index ![${\rm{\Gamma }}=2.21\pm {0.14}_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm {0.20}_{\mathrm{sys}}$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/841/2/100/revision1/apjaa729eieqn2.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691718888&Signature=mp3%2FKf1GNCSZgXJi96aj8a%2F6bIg%3D) and an exponential cut-off ![${E}_{0}=5.4\pm {1.1}_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm {1.0}_{\mathrm{sys}}$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/841/2/100/revision1/apjaa729eieqn3.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691718888&Signature=N%2B0Z%2Fsp5cco6d3wwVd3ULIBurFw%3D) TeV. For Mrk 501, we find an index ![${\rm{\Gamma }}=1.60\pm {0.30}_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm {0.20}_{\mathrm{sys}}$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/841/2/100/revision1/apjaa729eieqn4.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691718888&Signature=exQivhGeuZgRwj6yOwBogtRAbUg%3D) and exponential cut-off ![${E}_{0}=5.7\pm {1.6}_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm {1.0}_{\mathrm{sys}}$](https://cfn-live-content-bucket-iop-org.s3.amazonaws.com/journals/0004-637X/841/2/100/revision1/apjaa729eieqn5.gif?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAYDKQL6LTV7YY2HIK&Expires=1691718888&Signature=U4qy%2BMtI4oByXVZO0SypNSKJOsU%3D) TeV. The light curves for both sources show clear variability and a Bayesian analysis is applied to identify changes between flux states. The highest per-transit fluxes observed from Mrk 421 exceed the Crab Nebula flux by a factor of approximately five. For Mrk 501, several transits show fluxes in excess of three times the Crab Nebula flux. In a comparison to lower energy gamma-ray and X-ray monitoring data with comparable sampling, we cannot identify clear counterparts for the most significant flaring features observed by HAWC.

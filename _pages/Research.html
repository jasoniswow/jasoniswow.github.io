              Mining the potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating modern diseases requires a profound understanding of its action mechanism and a comprehensive knowledge system that seamlessly bridges modern medical insights with traditional theories. 
              However, existing databases for modernizing TCM are plagued by varying degrees of information loss, which impede the multidimensional dissection of pharmacological effects. 
              To address this challenge, we introduce traditional Chinese medicine modernization (TCMM), the currently largest modernized TCM database that integrates pioneering intelligent pipelines. 
              By aligning high-quality TCM and modern medicine data, TCMM boasts the most extensive TCM modernization knowledge, including 20 types of modernized TCM concepts such as prescription, ingredient, target and 46 biological relations among them, totaling 3,447,023 records. 
              We demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of TCMM with two features, prescription generation and knowledge discovery, the outcomes show consistency with biological experimental results.

              Molecular property prediction, crucial for early drug candidate screening and optimization, has seen advancements with deep learning-based methods. 
              While deep learning-based methods have advanced considerably, they often fall short in fully leveraging 3D spatial information. 
              Specifcally, current molecular encoding techniques tend to inadequately extract spatial information, leading to ambiguous representations where a single one might represent multiple distinct molecules.
              Moreover, existing molecular modeling methods focus predominantly on the most stable 3D conformations, neglecting other viable conformations present in reality. 
              To address these issues, we propose 3D-Mol, a novel approach designed for more accurate spatial structure representation. 
              It deconstructs molecules into three hierarchical graphs to better extract geometric information. 
              Additionally, 3D-Mol leverages contrastive learning for pretraining on 20 million unlabeled data, treating their conformations with identical topological structures as weighted positive pairs and contrasting ones as negatives, based on the similarity of their 3D conformation descriptors and fngerprints. 
              We compare 3D-Mol with various state-of-the-art baselines on 7 benchmarks and demonstrate our outstanding performance.

              Protein function prediction is currently achieved by encoding its sequence or structure, where the sequence-to-function transcendence and high-quality structural data scarcity lead to obvious performance bottlenecks. 
              Protein domains are "building blocks" of proteins that are functionally independent, and their combinations determine the diverse biological functions. 
              However, most existing studies have yet to thoroughly explore the intricate functional information contained in the protein domains. 
              To fill this gap, we propose a synergistic integration approach for a functionaware domain representation, and a domain-joint contrastive learning strategy to distinguish different protein functions while aligning the modalities. 
              Specifically, we associate domains with the GO terms as function priors to pre-train domain embeddings. 
              Furthermore, we partition proteins into multiple sub-views based on continuous joint domains for contrastive training under the supervision of a novel triplet InfoNCE loss. 
              Our approach significantly and comprehensively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, and clearly differentiates proteins carrying distinct functions compared to the competitor.

              Language models pretrained by self-supervised learning (SSL) have been widely utilized to study protein sequences, while few models were developed for genomic sequences and were limited to single species. 
              Due to the lack of genomes from different species, these models cannot effectively leverage evolutionary information. 
              In this study, we have developed SpliceBERT, a language model pretrained on primary ribonucleic acids (RNA) sequences from 72 vertebrates by masked language modeling, and applied it to sequencebased modeling of RNA splicing. 
              Pretraining SpliceBERT on diverse species enables effective identification of evolutionarily conserved elements. 
              Meanwhile, the learned hidden states and attention weights can characterize the biological properties of splice sites. 
              As a result, SpliceBERT was shown effective on several downstream tasks: zero-shot prediction of variant effects on splicing, prediction of branchpoints in humans, and cross-species prediction of splice sites. 
              Our study highlighted the importance of pretraining genomic language models on a diverse range of species and suggested that SSL is a promising approach to enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic underlying genomic sequences.

    <h3>A Self-feedback Knowledge Elicitation Approach for Chemical Reaction Predictions</h3>

              The task of chemical reaction predictions (CRPs) plays a pivotal role in advancing drug discovery and material science. 
              However, its effectiveness is constrained by the vast and uncertain chemical reaction space and challenges in capturing reaction selectivity, particularly due to existing methods’ limitations in exploiting the data’s inherent knowledge. 
              To address these challenges, we introduce a data-curated self-feedback knowledge elicitation approach. 
              This method starts from iterative optimization of molecular representations and facilitates the extraction of knowledge on chemical reaction types (RTs). 
              Then, we employ adaptive prompt learning to infuse the prior knowledge into the large language model (LLM). 
              As a result, we achieve significant enhancements: a 14.2% increase in retrosynthesis prediction accuracy, a 74.2% rise in reagent prediction accuracy, and an expansion in the model’s capability for handling multi-task chemical reactions. 
              This research offers a novel paradigm for knowledge elicitation in scientific research and showcases the untapped potential of LLMs in CRPs.

    <h3>Cytokine expression patterns: A single-cell RNA sequencing and machine learning based roadmap for cancer classification</h3>

              Cytokines are small protein molecules that exhibit potent immunoregulatory properties, which are known as the essential components of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). 
              While some cytokines are known to be universally upregulated in TIME, the unique cytokine expression patterns have not been fully resolved in specific types of cancers. 
              To address this challenge, we develop a TIME single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, which is designed to study cytokine expression patterns for precise cancer classification. 
              The dataset, including 39 cancers, is constructed by integrating 684 tumor scRNA-seq samples from multiple public repositories. 
              After screening and processing, the dataset retains only the expression data of immune cells. 
              With a machine learning classification model, unique cytokine expression patterns are identified for various cancer categories and pioneering applied to cancer classification with an accuracy rate of 78.01%. 
              Our method will not only boost the understanding of cancer-type-specific immune modulations in TIME but also serve as a crucial reference for future diagnostic and therapeutic research in cancer immunity.

              Large language models have made significant strides in natural language processing, enabling innovative applications in molecular science by processing textual representations of molecules. 
              However, most existing language models cannot capture the rich information with complex molecular structures or images. 
              In this paper, we introduce GIT-Mol, a multi-modal large language model that integrates the Graph, Image, and Text information. 
              To facilitate the integration of multi-modal molecular data, we propose GIT-Former, a novel architecture that is capable of aligning all modalities into a unified latent space. 
              We achieve a 5%–10% accuracy increase in properties prediction and a 20.2% boost in molecule generation validity compared to the baselines. 
              With the any-to-language molecular translation strategy, our model has the potential to perform more downstream tasks, such as compound name recognition and chemical reaction prediction.

              Analyzing the drug response at the cellular level is crucial for identifying biomarkers and understanding the mechanisms of resistance. 
              Although studies on the drug response of individual cells can provide novel insights into tumor heterogeneity, pharmacogenomic data related to single-cell (SC) RNA sequencing is often limited. 
              Transfer learning provides a promising approach to translate the knowledge of drug response from bulk cell lines to SC analysis, potentially providing an effective solution to this challenge. 
              Previous studies often use data from single drug-cell lines to pre-train specific models and adapt the models on SC datasets, which lack pharmacogenomic information from other drugs and hinder model generalization. 
              In this work, we introduce MetaSCDrug as a unified meta pre-training framework that integrates molecular information with transcriptomic data to simultaneously modeling cellular heterogeneity in response to multiple pre-trained drugs and generalize to unseen drugs. 
              Our model requires only one pre-training session, followed by fine-tuning on multiple single-cell datasets by few-shot learning, achieving an average of 4.58% accuracy increase in drug response prediction compared to the baselines. 
              Furthermore, our meta pre-training strategy effectively captures transcriptome heterogeneity in the generalization of unseen drugs, achieving a 20% improvement over the model without meta pre-training. 
              Case studies of our framework highlight its capability to identify critical genes for resistance, providing a method for exploring drug action pathways and understanding resistance mechanisms.

              Mining the potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in treating modern diseases requires a profound understanding of its action mechanism and a comprehensive knowledge system that seamlessly bridges modern medical insights with traditional theories. 
              However, existing databases for modernizing TCM are plagued by varying degrees of information loss, which impede the multidimensional dissection of pharmacological effects. 
              To address this challenge, we introduce traditional Chinese medicine modernization (TCMM), the currently largest modernized TCM database that integrates pioneering intelligent pipelines. 
              By aligning high-quality TCM and modern medicine data, TCMM boasts the most extensive TCM modernization knowledge, including 20 types of modernized TCM concepts such as prescription, ingredient, target and 46 biological relations among them, totaling 3,447,023 records. 
              We demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of TCMM with two features, prescription generation and knowledge discovery, the outcomes show consistency with biological experimental results.

<h1>AI for Temporal Data</h1>
<p>
  Temporal data, also known as time series data, is a sequence of observations recorded at regular intervals over time. 
  This data can be found in various forms, such as stock prices, gravitational wave, weather forecasts, and sensor readings from IoT devices. 
  Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various fields, and temporal data analysis is no exception. 
  The ability to understand and predict patterns from time series data has significant implications for businesses across industries. 
  Moreover, AI for temporal data analysis holds significant commercial value across various industries. 
  From astronomical discoveries and weather forecasting to customer behavior analysis and financial applications, the insights gained from this data can drive informed decision-making and competitive advantage. 
  As AI techniques continue to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications and benefits in the future.

<p style="text-align:justify">We have integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from multiple public databases, filtering 695 processed tumor immune cell samples to construct a tumor immune microenvironment single-cell dataset covering 39 types of cancer (currently the largest tumor immune microenvironment dataset). To address the issue of overly generalized data visualization results, we designed a refined data processing workflow and applied a random forest model to extract unique cellular factor expression patterns for various cancer categories. This pioneering approach enabled high-precision cancer type discrimination based on the expression of immune microenvironment cellular factors. This discovery not only deepens our understanding of the type-specific immune regulation within the tumor immune microenvironment but also provides essential references for future cancer diagnosis and treatment, markedly demonstrating the tremendous potential and application value of artificial intelligence in the field of biomedical research.

<h3>Large-Scale Natural Ingredient Database and Intelligent Bioactivity Analysis</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">We have constructed a natural product data platform that integrates both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine information, aiming to realize the modernization of TCM and provide in-depth support for precision diagnosis, treatment, and drug development. This platform integrates the core concepts of TCM and modern medicine by fusing 49 kinds of entity relationships, including traditional medicinal materials, TCM symptoms, prescriptions, and modern medicine entities such as molecules, targets, pathways, and drug side effects. This integration has led to the creation of a TCM modernization knowledge graph containing over 5 million triplets. To support knowledge discovery within the platform, we employed a pre-trained heterogeneous graph model to handle this complex data, utilizing advanced AI technologies for deep mining, and implementing various pharmaceutical services such as drug repositioning, side effect prediction, drug target prediction, and dosage prescription generation. Furthermore, we have constructed an online platform to intuitively display the data and enable online prescription generation. This method not only effectively interprets the knowledge of natural products in both Chinese and Western medicine but also exhibits high consistency with real experimental results, providing robust support for the modernization of TCM, new drug discovery, and personalized treatment. Additionally, we have collected 378 TCM prescriptions for enteritis and employed a novel and effective data augmentation strategy to expand the training dataset. We have utilized a deep neural network comprising 9,845 nodes and 161,950 edges, incorporating microscopic information through feature embedding, including bioactive molecules, protein targets, and prescription extraction features. Subsequent network pharmacology validation revealed that the ten most common ingredients in the AI-generated prescriptions were related to various inflammatory signaling pathways. To further validate the bioactive components in the generated prescriptions, we selected five effective ingredients for wet-lab experiments on BALB/c mice with colitis and confirmed their inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory factors. This demonstrated the reliability of our AI model in identifying bioactive components from TCM prescriptions.

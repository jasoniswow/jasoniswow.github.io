<h3>Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Large Models for Small-Molecule Drug Generation and Description</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">We are dedicated to the development of an innovative multimodal large model in the fields of drug discovery and molecular biology, aiming to provide new perspectives and solutions for understanding and utilizing multimodal molecular data. To this end, we have designed and implemented a multimodal AI large model capable of simultaneously processing images, graphs, and text. Through a novel cross-modal fusion approach (identifying and extracting correlations between different modalities and implementing cross-fusion of information, thereby generating a unified embedding that integrates multimodal information), our model achieves an organic interaction and efficient fusion among these three modalities. Our model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various small-molecule drug tasks, with the ability to understand and handle multimodal molecular data. It has accomplished accurate prediction of molecular properties, as well as the generation and description of molecules in response to textual prompts, showing superior performance in comparison with models of similar levels.

<p style="text-align:justify">By designing novel molecular representation methods and utilizing the force field computations and knowledge-base optimization features of RDKit, we generate 3D conformations of molecules from molecular topological graphs. Subsequently, we decompose the molecular conformations into point-edge graphs, bond-angle graphs, and dihedral-angle graphs to comprehensively characterize the spatial information of molecules and extract the 3D structure of small-molecule drugs. We have designed a molecular encoder based on a message-passing model and pre-trained their model using extensive unlabeled small-molecule data through a self-supervised contrastive learning approach (using molecular topological graphs). Our AI model has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in several aspects of small-molecule drug property prediction.

<h2>AI for Protein</h2>
</br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
  In recent years, AI algorithms have made significant advancements in the field of protein research, particularly in the area of protein structure prediction. 
  For instance, the AlphaFold3 can predict the binding states between proteins and their ligands. 
  However, Protein structures and functions are highly complex and diverse. And the intricate interplay and dependencies between protein structure and function is not fully captured by current AI algorithms. 
  In addiction, protein structures are inherently dynamic, undergoing complex conformational changes that are crucial for their function but challenging to capture with AI algorithms.

<h3>Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Large Models for Small-Molecule Drug Generation and Description</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">We are dedicated to the development of an innovative multimodal large model in the fields of drug discovery and molecular biology, aiming to provide new perspectives and solutions for understanding and utilizing multimodal molecular data. To this end, we have designed and implemented a multimodal AI large model capable of simultaneously processing images, graphs, and text. Through a novel cross-modal fusion approach (identifying and extracting correlations between different modalities and implementing cross-fusion of information, thereby generating a unified embedding that integrates multimodal information), our model achieves an organic interaction and efficient fusion among these three modalities. Our model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various small-molecule drug tasks, with the ability to understand and handle multimodal molecular data. It has accomplished accurate prediction of molecular properties, as well as the generation and description of molecules in response to textual prompts, showing superior performance in comparison with models of similar levels.

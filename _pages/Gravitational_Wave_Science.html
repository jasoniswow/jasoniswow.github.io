<p style="text-align:justify">Utilizing deep learning to separate signal from noise and mine information in commonly low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data in scientific domains: (1) To address the computational complexity bottleneck of existing Transformer models, we propose a multi-dimensional sparse self-attention method, achieving efficient training for models with up to billions of parameters. By integrating multi-level embedding features and training with a masked objective function, this method is applied to the field of signal denoising in low SNR data, achieving the best denoising effects in the current domain. (2) To overcome the limitation of existing CNNs that cannot handle ultra-long time-series signals, we propose an architecture combining dilated convolutions and recurrent neural networks. This structure enables long-term memory in the algorithm, fully learning the features of ultra-long sequences, and its application in signal detection has substantially improved detection accuracy. (3) To address the bottleneck of lengthy computational time in traditional matched filtering and Monte Carlo sampling methods, we propose a time-series signal parameter inversion algorithm based on Normalizing Flow. This deep learning algorithm can replace traditional methods, accelerating convergence through a massive number of trainable parameters. Leveraging the powerful computing capabilities of intelligent computing clusters and applying them to the field of signal parameter inversion, this method simultaneously enhances the speed and accuracy of signal parameter inversion. (4) In response to the current scarcity of open-source time-series datasets in the scientific field, we have constructed an open-source database platform and provided various categories of time-series datasets for researchers to download. Additionally, to overcome the bottlenecks of time-consuming generation, significant storage space occupation, and time-consuming data loading for long-term time-series data, we propose an adaptive parallel generation method based on in-memory databases. This solution provides ample data for large model training, accelerating the training of large-scale AI models.
